# Data-Analysis

The University Endowment Fund case study looks at two datasets of university endowment market values in 2021 and 2023. Utilizing Microsoft Excel and SQL, I took a deep dive into the data to understand which schools are the high perfromers, the size of their investment retures and more. The SQL code in this project covers the questions listed below. 

2021 data: 
1.	Which five colleges have the highest endowments?
2.	What is the total amount of the top 5 endowments?
3.	How does the total of the top 15 endowments compare to the bottom 105?
4.	How much do all the institutions hold as of the end of 2023?
5.	What percentage of the total endowment amount does the top 15 institutions hold?
6.	Which 10 colleges had the highest endowment returns in 2023?
7.	How much did those institutions return in 2023?
8.	How much did the top 15 college return in 2023?
9.	Which institutions have endowment returns of over 40% in the last year?
10.	What is the mean, mode and median of the pct_changeâ€™s?
11.	 What are the rankings of the institutions based on their annual returns?

2023 data: 
1. Which college had the highest positive changes in their fund market values in 2023?
2. What schools have enrollments per student equal to more than $500,000? These are all the schools that pay a 1.4% tax on net investment income.
3. What state has the largest sum of endowment funds?
4. Which states receive the most tax revenue from endowment funds with e_per_student >= 500,000?
5. Which cities have the highest sum of endowmend funds?
6. Which institutions saw the greatest decreses in their endowment market values in 2023?
7. Which schools had the largest increases in market value?
8. Which universities with endowments over $1billion had increases in mv of over $1billion?
9. Were there more increase or decreases in the mv of endowments in 2023?
10. Find the quartile ranges of the delta_mv.

Please Note: 
Data points in both sets are in 1,000s and assumptions
